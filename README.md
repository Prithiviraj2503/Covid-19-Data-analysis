# Covid-19-Data-analysis

This project is about simple covid-19 data analysis. Absolutely it is a begginer level project. I developed this project to enhance my skill in data analytics, data visualization and to be learn about supervised machine learning algorithms. Data were collected from kaggle plotform. I have applied some data preprocessing methodologies such as filling missing data, removing noisy data, Convert the numerical values into continous values by using one-hot encoding. I plotted the data using matplotlib and applied some basic level analysis on the data. I applied logistic regression ranking method to select features. Later the data trained using various supervised learning algorithms such as decision tree learning, random forest, SVM, GaussianNB. I achieved 85% of maximum accuracy in the decision tree classifier.
